## The Gui is used as followed:
- An image must be loaded from a file by pressing the load button. The image is loaded into the model, 
  and then the image is displayed in the view.
- The image can be edited by using the commands: blur, brighten, darken, greyscale, 
flip, sharpen, and save.
- The edits are executed by pressing the appropriate button. 
- For the brighten and darken commands, the user must provide a value to adjust the brightness 
or darkeness by. If the value is not provided, an error message will display.
- Once the image is edited, the user can save the image to a file by pressing the save button.
